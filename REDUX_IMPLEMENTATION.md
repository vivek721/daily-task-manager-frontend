# Redux Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Daily Task Manager has been successfully refactored to use Redux Toolkit for state management, replacing the previous useState-based local state. This provides better state management, predictable state updates, and improved developer tools support.

## Architecture

### 1. Store Configuration (`src/store/store.ts`)
- **Redux Toolkit**: Uses `configureStore` for simplified store setup
- **Redux Persist**: Automatically saves and restores state from localStorage
- **Middleware**: Configured to handle non-serializable values (Date objects in tasks)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types

### 2. Task Slice (`src/store/taskSlice.ts`)
**State Structure:**
```typescript
interface TaskState {
  tasks: Task[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

**Actions Implemented:**
- `addTask(TaskFormData)` - Creates a new task with UUID and timestamps
- `toggleTaskComplete(id)` - Toggles task completion status
- `deleteTask(id)` - Removes task from state
- `updateTask(Partial<Task> & {id})` - Updates any task field
- `setTasks(Task[])` - Bulk set tasks (for data migration)
- `clearTasks()` - Remove all tasks
- `setLoading(boolean)` - Update loading state
- `setError(string | null)` - Handle error states

### 3. Selectors (`src/store/selectors.ts`)
**Memoized selectors for performance:**
- `selectTasks` - All tasks
- `selectTaskById(id)` - Single task by ID
- `selectCompletedTasks` - Completed tasks only
- `selectPendingTasks` - Incomplete tasks only
- `selectTasksByPriority` - Tasks sorted by priority and completion
- `selectTodaysTasks` - Tasks for today (due today or created today)
- `selectOtherTasks` - All non-today tasks
- `selectOverdueTasks` - Tasks past their due date
- `selectTaskStats` - Aggregated statistics
- `selectTasksByCategory` - Tasks grouped by category

### 4. Typed Hooks (`src/store/hooks.ts`)
- `useAppDispatch()` - Typed dispatch hook
- `useAppSelector()` - Typed selector hook

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Centralized State Management**
- Single source of truth for all task data
- Predictable state updates through reducers
- Easy debugging with Redux DevTools

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Memoized selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Component re-rendering only when relevant data changes
- Efficient data filtering and sorting

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- Redux Persist automatically saves state to localStorage
- Seamless data restoration on app reload
- Configurable persistence (can exclude sensitive data)

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Full TypeScript support with type inference
- Redux DevTools integration for debugging
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new features and actions
- Clean architecture for additional slices
- Middleware support for async operations

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Task
```typescript
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

const handleAddTask = (taskData: TaskFormData) => {
  dispatch(addTask(taskData));
};
```

### Selecting Today's Tasks
```typescript
const todaysTasks = useAppSelector(selectTodaysTasks);
```

### Task Statistics
```typescript
const stats = useAppSelector(selectTaskStats);
// { total: 10, completed: 7, pending: 3, overdue: 1, completionRate: 70 }
```

## Migration from Local State

### Before (useState + useLocalStorage)
```typescript
const [tasks, setTasks] = useLocalStorage<Task[]>('daily-tasks', []);

const addTask = (taskData: TaskFormData) => {
  const newTask = { /* create task object */ };
  setTasks(prev => [...prev, newTask]);
};
```

### After (Redux)
```typescript
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
const tasks = useAppSelector(selectTasks);

const handleAddTask = (taskData: TaskFormData) => {
  dispatch(addTask(taskData));
};
```

## File Structure
```
src/store/
├── store.ts          # Store configuration with persistence
├── taskSlice.ts      # Task actions and reducers
├── selectors.ts      # Memoized selectors
└── hooks.ts          # Typed Redux hooks
```

## Persistence Configuration

Redux Persist is configured to:
- Store data in localStorage under the key 'root'
- Only persist the 'tasks' slice (excludes UI state)
- Handle Date objects in task data properly
- Show loading state during rehydration

## Future Enhancements

The Redux architecture supports easy addition of:
- **Async Actions**: Using `createAsyncThunk` for API calls
- **Additional Slices**: User preferences, UI state, etc.
- **Middleware**: Logging, analytics, validation
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration
- **Optimistic Updates**: For better UX during API calls

## Development Tools

### Redux DevTools
Access the Redux DevTools extension in your browser to:
- Inspect state changes over time
- Time-travel debug (undo/redo actions)
- Export/import state snapshots
- Monitor performance

### TypeScript Integration
Full type safety with:
- Inferred action types
- Typed selector results  
- Compile-time error checking
- IntelliSense support

## Performance Considerations

1. **Selector Memoization**: Using `createSelector` prevents unnecessary recalculations
2. **Component Optimization**: Only components using changed data re-render
3. **Bundle Size**: Redux Toolkit includes only necessary Redux features
4. **Memory Usage**: Efficient state normalization and cleanup

This Redux implementation provides a solid foundation for scaling the Daily Task Manager with additional features while maintaining excellent performance and developer experience.
